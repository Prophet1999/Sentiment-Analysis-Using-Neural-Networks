Minor Project

Goals
Regardless of the name, the goal of sentiment analysis is the same: to know a user or audience opinion on a target object by analyzing a vast amount of text from various sources. You can analyze text on different levels of detail, and the detail level depends on your goals.

Objective
 The project mainly deals analysis of product reviews from various 
ecommerce websites.
 Our Main objective is to get the overall polarity of reviews for a 
particular product

The whole project is available in my github repository which are basically all the model files presentation, model, report Kaggle and Custom Datasets.

 Identify the orientation of opinion in a piece of text
 Can be generalized to a wider set of emotions

Metrics for measuring Success
As a classification problem, Sentiment Analysis uses the evaluation metrics of Precision, Recall, F-score, and Accuracy. Also, average measures like macro, micro, and weighted F1-scores are useful for multi-class problems. Depending on the balance of classes of the dataset the most appropriate metric should be used

Sentiment Analysis
 Movie: is this review positive or negative?
 Products: what do people think about the new iPhone?
 Public sentiment: how is consumer confidence?
Is despair increasing?
 Politics: what do people think about this candidate or issue?
 Prediction: predict election outcomes or market trends
from sentiment

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
 Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is a field of study that 
analyzes people’s sentiments, attitudes, or emotions towards 
certain entities. This project deal with a fundamental problem of 
sentiment analysis, sentiment polarity categorization. Online 
product reviews from Amazon.com are selected as data used for 
this project. 
 We plan to use more exhaustive techniques in future to build a 
full-fledged model that is able to analyse a large set of data in a 
little time and with good accuracy.
